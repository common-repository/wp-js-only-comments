== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

Most SPAM is sent using scripts that post directly to your blog software without loading your blog in a browser and so, without running Javascript. By only allowing comments posted with Javascript, you will not even see all those spam comments.

= I still get SPAM, what to do? =

Usually you will still get some SPAM comments for Cialis or Viagra etc. Add these words in your Blacklist in the Wordpress Admin page / Settings / Discussion
